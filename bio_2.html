        <h1> My Background Study</h1>
        <hr>
        <p align="justify"> <font size="04" face="Arial">Assalamualaikum and hi, my name is <b>Mohamad Safwan Qayyum Bin Zainal Abidin</b>. This is my short story about my study background. 
        In primary school. In UPSR, I got 2A, 2B and 1C. It is quite frustrating because my target in UPSR is 2A and 3B or 3A and 2B, but it is okay.</font> </p>

        <p align="justify"> <font size="04" face="Arial">In secondary school, in form one, I was in the second grade at the time but in a few weeks, I was in the first class because my father asked the teacher to put me in the first class. 
        My form one results are not as good as I had hoped. It was a disaster. But that is fine, I will try it in form two. I am still in the same class in form two. However, my findings remain the same. 
        It is because <em><b>I do not care about my studies and spend a lot of time playing video games</b></em>. However, in form 3, I try to focus on my studies since I want to achieve more A’s in my PT3. In class, I pay attention and do my assignments.</font> </p>

        <p align="justify"> <font size="04" face="Arial">Alhamdulillah, I received many A's on my PT3, yet it is still a poor grade because I failed in Math subject. In form four, I am introduced to new elective subjects such as Business, Science Computer and Geography. At first, I feel like these three additional subjects are interfering with my ability to concentrate on getting more A's in my studies. 
        Consequently, my final test paper only scored a C and a D. I am frustrated and depressed because I am unable to make my parents proud of me. As a result, I will have to build something till I have a satisfactory outcome. I worked hard in class and went to additional classes with a friend until the coronavirus broke out in our nation and the school had to close. 
        Since then, we, the batch 03, have been required to complete an online study. 
        It was so difficult to comprehend that I became irritated with SPM and became sluggish to study. 
        I lost my motivation to study and became even more stressed. </font>

        </p>

        <p align="justify"> <font size="04" face="Arial">The school reopens after three months of the PKP. I have had to be more optimistic and diligent in my studies since that day. I made a study timetable. In my SPM results day, I get 4 A, 4 B and 1 C. For the first time, there is no D in my subject. I was crying and proud of myself because I know how struggle to I get back my spirit to study and push myself until the last day of SPM. 
        I am happy too because I can make my parents happy. I believe with one quote which is:</font> 

        <blockquote><font size="05" face="Courier New"><b>“مَنْ جَدَّ وَجَدَ"</b> </font>
               
        </blockquote>

        </p>
        <p><ins>This quote means anyone who strives (InsyaAllah) will get what he strives for</ins> </p>

        <p align="center"> <font size="04" face="Arial">So that’s all about me and my story. Thank you!</font></p>
